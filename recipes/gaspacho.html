    <h2>Descriptions</h2>
    <p>Gaspacho, also called Andalusian gazpacho, is a cold soup made of raw, blended vegetables.[1] It originated in the southern regions of the Iberian peninsula and spread into other areas. Gazpacho is widely eaten in Spain and Portugal, particularly during hot summers, as it is refreshing and cool.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <li>2 lb. tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 Persian cucumbers</li>
        <li>1/2 red bell pepper</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic</li>
        <li>2 tbsp.  red wine or sherry vinegar</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine tomatoes, cucumbers, pepper, garlic, vinegar, and water in the bowl of a food processor or blender. Blend until smooth, then add olive oil and blend to combine. Taste and season with salt, pepper, and more vinegar if needed. Cover and refrigerate until chilled.
